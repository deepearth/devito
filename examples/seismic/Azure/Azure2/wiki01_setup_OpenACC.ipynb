    "# Using Devito on GPUs with PGI OpenACC (environment setup)\n",
    "\n",
    "This instruction shows step by step how to set up the environment for running [Devito](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito) on an [Azure GPU VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu). It is inherited and modified from [Using Devito on GPUs with PGI OpenACC](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/wiki/Using-Devito-on-GPUs-with-PGI-OpenACC) at [Devito wiki](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/wiki). Although ultimately we would like to automate the whole installation in this document, the [PGI compiler package](https://www.pgroup.com/support/download_community.php?file=pgi-community-linux-x64) needs to be downloaded manually due to its license agreement (Unfortunately `wget` and `curl` do not work).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this instruction requires some basic knowledge of Azure, Linux and Python. After you go through this instruciton targeting GPU, the environment should allow you to run Devito on both GPU and CPU, where the switch between GPU and CPU is enabled by a few [Devito environment variables](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/wiki/FAQ#DEVITO_ARCH). However, if you are only interested in running Devito on an Azure CPU VM (as compared to a GPU VM), follow [this instruction](https://www.devitoproject.org/devito/download.html) which is much simpler. In both cases, keep in mind to pick a VM with a reasonable memory size for your Devito jobs."

    "\n",
    "First, create a Virtual Machine ([VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/)) instead of Data Science Virtual Machine ([DSVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/)) on Azure in this case. DSVM has pre-installed packages such as conda, python3 and cuda which may cause confusion, so we stick to a bare Linux VM. \n",
    "\n",
    "In [Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/azure-portal/), choose \"Create a resource\", then pick \"Compute\" from \"Azure Marketplace\". Next choose \"Virtual machine\" and pick \"Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS\" as the image. Pick \"Review+create\" to create the Linux VM.\n",

    "We have validated that the PGI OpenACC compiler works on all Nvidia Tesla [K80, P100, V100, P40, M60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported) GPUs. So for this exercise, suggest you pick one of the [NC6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nc-series), [NC6s_v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ncv2-series?toc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/toc.json&bc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/breadcrumb/toc.json), [NC6s_v3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series?toc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/toc.json&bc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/breadcrumb/toc.json), [ND6s](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nd-series?toc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/toc.json&bc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/breadcrumb/toc.json), [NV6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nv-series?toc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/toc.json&bc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/breadcrumb/toc.json) VMs which is equiped with one GPU. Alternatively, you can pick one of the NC24, NC24s_v2, NC24s_v3, ND24s, NV24 VMs where you can take advantage of the Devito MPI (domain decomposition) feature by using all 4 GPUs (per VM).\n",

The commands can also run under [Azure serial console](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/serial-console-overview).
